In addition to consulting and tools, Futurelab Studios conducts hands-on AI
enablement workshops and training programs for individuals, teams, and
organizations.

These programs are designed to build confidence and practical skills in using
AI effectively. Sessions focus on real-world use cases, responsible AI practices,
and guided hands-on learning rather than purely theoretical instruction.

Workshops range from AI essentials for all team members, to deep-dive sessions
for specific functions such as marketing or sales, and advanced builder programs
where teams prototype and develop working AI solutions.
